# Chickadee-Client

## Description

Chickadee is a basic social media website based on Twitter.com, and built as part of a "Social Media Wargames" project. The purpose of Social Media Wargames test moderation strategies by building model websites, attacking them, and then measuring how well the moderation strategy handles the attack.

## Status

Chickadee is in the early stages of development. The model is still being designed, and no moderation strategy has been implemented.

## Setup

A development server can be run by cloning the repo locally, installing dependencies, and then running the development server:
```
git clone git@github.com:jacobabrennan/chickadee-client.git
yarn install
yarn start
```
After a pause the home page should open automatically in the browser. In order to login and test the functionality of the client, you will also need to be running the [Chickadee back end](https://github.com/jacobabrennan/chickadee).
