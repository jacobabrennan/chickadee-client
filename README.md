# Chickadee-Client

Ahoy Fred!

This is the front end of a social media experiment. The backend can be found here:
https://github.com/jacobabrennan/chickadee

The project is still under development, and no production build exists. In the meantime, you can run the experiment via the command `yarn start`. The project is a social media website based on Twitter. It is built using React, with Apollo for use with GraphQL. Users can register an account, login, update their profile, view other users, and make "posts" (analogous to tweets).

For an example of a component using hooks for both state management and GraphQL, as well as rendering JSX, see the file [src/components/composer/index.js](https://github.com/jacobabrennan/chickadee-client/blob/master/src/components/composer/index.js).

Thanks for taking the time to look at this project, it means a lot to me!
